# Interactive Map Application

## Project Overview

This project is a modern web mapping application that provides an interactive interface for exploring Bangalore's geographical features. The application was built with a focus on performance, user experience, and maintainability.

## Development Journey

### Initial Planning
- Identified the need for a web-based mapping solution to visualize Bangalore's points of interest and transportation routes
- Chose React as the frontend framework for its component-based architecture and performance benefits
- Selected TypeScript for type safety and better development experience
- Decided on Leaflet.js for its lightweight nature and extensive plugin ecosystem

### Technical Decisions

#### Frontend Framework
- **React 18**: Chosen for its virtual DOM, component reusability, and large ecosystem
- **TypeScript**: Added for better maintainability and reduced runtime errors
- **Vite**: Selected as build tool for its fast development server and optimized builds

#### Mapping Technology
- **Leaflet.js**: Core mapping library chosen for its lightweight nature and extensive documentation
- **React-Leaflet**: React wrapper for Leaflet to maintain React's component lifecycle
- **OpenStreetMap**: Used as base map tiles for street view
- **Esri World Imagery**: Selected for satellite view due to its high-quality imagery

#### Styling
- **Tailwind CSS**: Chosen for its utility-first approach and easy customization
- **Lucide React**: Used for consistent and modern icons throughout the application

### Component Architecture

#### Core Components

1. **MapContainer.tsx**
   - Central component that manages the map instance
   - Handles all map interactions and state management
   - Manages layer loading and rendering
   - Implements custom marker functionality

2. **BasemapControls.tsx**
   - Provides toggle functionality between street and satellite views
   - Handles tile layer switching
   - Maintains state for current basemap

3. **LayerControls.tsx**
   - Manages visibility of different GeoJSON layers
   - Provides toggle switches for Points of Interest and Routes & Zones layers
   - Maintains layer state and handles layer-specific styling

4. **MarkerTool.tsx**
   - Implements custom marker placement functionality
   - Handles user interactions for marker placement
   - Manages marker state and popups

5. **LocationButton.tsx**
   - Provides user location detection
   - Handles geolocation API integration
   - Navigates map to user's current position

#### Data Management

1. **GeoJSON Integration**
   - Implemented TypeScript interfaces for type-safe GeoJSON data
   - Created separate interfaces for different feature types
   - Implemented efficient data loading and rendering

2. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Implemented marker clustering for large datasets
   - Optimized GeoJSON rendering with styled layers
   - Implemented lazy loading for map tiles
   - Used virtual DOM for efficient updates

### User Experience Design

1. **Responsive Design**
   - Implemented mobile-first approach
   - Used Tailwind's responsive utilities
   - Created floating control panels for better visibility

2. **Interactive Features**
   - Added hover states and transitions
   - Implemented smooth animations
   - Created intuitive control interfaces

3. **Accessibility**
   - Added ARIA labels and roles
   - Implemented keyboard navigation
   - Ensured color contrast compliance
